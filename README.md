# Coachy-iOS

The vision:
Coachy creates a content-filled physical training platform, which
1. Allows each trainer to experiment with different types of training, with different trainers and to find the best trainer for him, easily and effectively.
2. Enables veteran and young coaches to increase their clientele, increase visibility and thus establish long-term relationships with prospects.

The problem:
1. Connection between trainers and coaches - Today trainers are looking for personal trainers using different methods like trial and error or friend recommendations, which are less effective and cumbersome methods.
2. The coaches find it difficult to find the target audience and create a stable customer base.

The solution:
1. Trainers:
* Coachy will make it easier for trainers to find a preferred fitness trainer, and provide digital training in a convenient and simple way.
* Convenient and immediate payment. * Unique user experience for the trainee.
2. Coaches:
* Coachy will create a clientele platform for fitness trainers, providing each coach with exposure to the clientele and advertising.
* Coachy will create another source of income for coaches based on photographic training.

Back to the category page (main page). The app name identifies whether you are a registered coach or not.
Clicking "Register as Coach" automatically takes you to a registration page without the option of viewing your wall (blocking the tab details)
and taking your data by your login type (Facebook, Google).
